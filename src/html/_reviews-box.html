                I am absolutely delighted with the result of my operation. I no longer need glasses to read my morning
                paper and no
                longer have to search for glasses .Professor Gartry filled me with confidence and calmness. I felt no
                pain, and was
                comfortable through the whole procedure. Thank you so much.

                “This is an enormous thank you for not only giving me the laser treatment that has given me back my
                sight, but for doing
                the treatment immediately, after your clinic hours. It was extremely kind of you to do it on the same
                day. The result
                was amazing. When I got home I realised I could see the actual leaves on the trees! I have been
                driving
                again (only when
                you can’t drive do you realise how ones life revolves round the car). I am so grateful for your help.”

                I am delighted with the results of my surgery. The fact that I am able to read most documents without
                reading glasses is
                an added bonus. The care I received during and after my surgery was second to none.

                Couldn't have asked for a better service or result – from start to finish the whole process has been
                honest, reassuring
                and transparent. I had laser eye surgery at a high street clinic so this was a corrective procedure
                and the difference
                has been worlds apart.
