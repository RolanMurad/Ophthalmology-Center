              Cataracts not only need to be operated on, they need to be operated on! After all, cataracts significantly
              reduce the
              quality of life. Also, the more mature the cataract, the more complications it causes: long procedures and
              postoperative
              period, more risk of complications. Also, there are variants of cataract development that lead to
              irreversible loss of
              vision.
