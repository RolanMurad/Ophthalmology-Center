        Cataracts can develop with age, as well as from eye trauma, previous eye surgery, degenerative myopia, or when
        taking a
        number of medications (antidepressants, glucocorticosteroids, etc.). Cataracts can cause blurred vision,
        sensitivity to
        light and glare.
      </p>
      <p class="service-info__text">
        If the cataract impairs your vision so much that it interferes with your daily life, you should consult an
        ophthalmologist to decide on further management of the patient.
